# Analyzing Stack Overflow Survey

In this project, I will analyze the Stack Overflow developer survey dataset. The dataset contains responses to an annual survey conducted by Stack Overflow. 

I will be using the following files:
1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema
#
Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.

### Inferences and Conclusions

I've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here are some of them:

- Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women and non-binary genders.


- The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although this is improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.


- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Thus, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.


- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers.


- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.
